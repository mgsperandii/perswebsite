 abstract = {Assessing temporal changes in plant communities is a core aim of
temporal ecology and a shared priority of global conservation agendas
which is particularly urgent in threatened ecosystems. Mediterranean
coastal dunes harbour some of the most threatened habitats in Europe.
Yet, surprisingly, studies capturing the recent temporal dynamics of
biodiversity in these systems by accounting for multiple diversity
facets and different aspects of community structure are missing.
Here, using data from a resurveying study, we provide a first
comprehensive, habitat-based, multi-faceted assessment of recent (10-15
years) temporal changes in threatened Mediterranean coastal dunes. To
this aim, we quantified taxonomic and functional changes in plant
communities using indices capturing multiple biodiversity features, and
we explored trends at both the community level and the species level. We
compared observed biodiversity changes across habitats (to look for
evidence of generalized biodiversity loss) and across facets (to infer
the potential loss of unique functions), and tested their significance
using a null model. Overall, we predicted large compositional shifts and
biodiversity loss beyond expectations in many communities, although with
differences among habitat types.
Our results reveal severe shifts in the taxonomic profile of the
communities, mostly driven by a non-random species loss, and little
temporal overlap in functional space, implying large changes in both
community structure and ecological strategies of the investigated
habitats. This, together with the disappearance of c. 23% of historical
plots and with substantial losses in focal species, suggests that
intense degradation processes are occurring in coastal dune habitats,
particularly on the upper beach and on shifting dunes.
Synthesis. This study provides the first evidence of large, often
non-random, taxonomic and functional changes occurring in Mediterranean
coastal dune plant communities in a surprisingly short time-span. Along
with furthering our knowledge of the recent dynamics affecting these
endangered ecosystems, our results also pinpoint the types of habitats
that are most at risk, helping to direct future conservation efforts and
management. Future research should now be directed at more precisely
testing potential drivers of these changes.},
