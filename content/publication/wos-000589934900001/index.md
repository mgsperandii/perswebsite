abstract: Assessing temporal changes in plant communities is a core aim of temporal
  ecology and a shared priority of global conservation agendas which is particularly
  urgent in threatened ecosystems. Mediterranean coastal dunes harbour some of the
  most threatened habitats in Europe. Yet, surprisingly, studies capturing the recent
  temporal dynamics of biodiversity in these systems by accounting for multiple diversity
  facets and different aspects of community structure are missing. Here, using data
  from a resurveying study, we provide a first comprehensive, habitat-based, multi-faceted
  assessment of recent (10-15 years) temporal changes in threatened Mediterranean
  coastal dunes. To this aim, we quantified taxonomic and functional changes in plant
  communities using indices capturing multiple biodiversity features, and we explored
  trends at both the community level and the species level. We compared observed biodiversity
  changes across habitats (to look for evidence of generalized biodiversity loss)
  and across facets (to infer the potential loss of unique functions), and tested
  their significance using a null model. Overall, we predicted large compositional
  shifts and biodiversity loss beyond expectations in many communities, although with
  differences among habitat types. Our results reveal severe shifts in the taxonomic
  profile of the communities, mostly driven by a non-random species loss, and little
  temporal overlap in functional space, implying large changes in both community structure
  and ecological strategies of the investigated habitats. This, together with the
  disappearance of c. 23% of historical plots and with substantial losses in focal
  species, suggests that intense degradation processes are occurring in coastal dune
  habitats, particularly on the upper beach and on shifting dunes. Synthesis. This
  study provides the first evidence of large, often non-random, taxonomic and functional
  changes occurring in Mediterranean coastal dune plant communities in a surprisingly
  short time-span. Along with furthering our knowledge of the recent dynamics affecting
  these endangered ecosystems, our results also pinpoint the types of habitats that
  are most at risk, helping to direct future conservation efforts and management.
  Future research should now be directed at more precisely testing potential drivers
  of these changes.
