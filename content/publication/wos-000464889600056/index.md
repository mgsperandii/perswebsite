abstract: 'Resurveying studies are commonly appreciated as a means to monitoring temporal
  changes in plant diversity. However, most of them still rely on phytosociological
  plots, which, although representing an invaluable source of data, can lead to biased
  estimates of vegetation changes. At the community-level, temporal changes can be
  quantified by means of beta-diversity measures. However, compositional variation
  can be the result of two different, often contrasting, processes: turnover and nestedness.
  In this context we test the effectiveness of resurveying approaches based on quasi-permanent
  plots in revealing temporal changes in herbaceous communities of Mediterranean coastal
  dune systems. Indeed, due to their being highly dynamic, coastal dunes can be considered
  ideal habitats for implementing such tools. In particular, we quantified temporal
  changes in species composition occurred over 10-15 years by calculating Sorensen
  index of dissimilarity and, in order to determine whether the change was really
  driven by species turnover, we partitioned Sorensen index into its two components
  of turnover and nestedness. At the same time, since diagnostic species are considered
  to be particularly sensitive to habitat modifications and helpful in assessing changes
  in the ecological structure of a community, we analyzed temporal changes in the
  occurrence and cover of diagnostic species of the investigated habitats. Results
  show that coastal dune communities of our study area underwent consistent changes
  during the analyzed time span. Almost 25% of the historical plots disappeared. Major
  transformations, mainly driven by species turnover, involved upper beach communities,
  embryonic and mobile dunes, as revealed by the parallel analysis of beta diversity
  and diagnostic species. This work shows how resurveying approaches can efficiently
  reveal useful insights on vegetation dynamics, therefore providing a solid basis
  for the implementation of effective conservation strategies, especially in endangered
  habitats.'
