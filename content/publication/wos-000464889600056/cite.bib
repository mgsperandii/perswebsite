 abstract = {Resurveying studies are commonly appreciated as a means to monitoring
temporal changes in plant diversity. However, most of them still rely on
phytosociological plots, which, although representing an invaluable
source of data, can lead to biased estimates of vegetation changes. At
the community-level, temporal changes can be quantified by means of
beta-diversity measures. However, compositional variation can be the
result of two different, often contrasting, processes: turnover and
nestedness. In this context we test the effectiveness of resurveying
approaches based on quasi-permanent plots in revealing temporal changes
in herbaceous communities of Mediterranean coastal dune systems. Indeed,
due to their being highly dynamic, coastal dunes can be considered ideal
habitats for implementing such tools. In particular, we quantified
temporal changes in species composition occurred over 10-15 years by
calculating Sorensen index of dissimilarity and, in order to determine
whether the change was really driven by species turnover, we partitioned
Sorensen index into its two components of turnover and nestedness. At
the same time, since diagnostic species are considered to be
particularly sensitive to habitat modifications and helpful in assessing
changes in the ecological structure of a community, we analyzed temporal
changes in the occurrence and cover of diagnostic species of the
investigated habitats. Results show that coastal dune communities of our
study area underwent consistent changes during the analyzed time span.
Almost 25% of the historical plots disappeared. Major transformations,
mainly driven by species turnover, involved upper beach communities,
embryonic and mobile dunes, as revealed by the parallel analysis of beta
diversity and diagnostic species. This work shows how resurveying
approaches can efficiently reveal useful insights on vegetation
dynamics, therefore providing a solid basis for the implementation of
effective conservation strategies, especially in endangered habitats.},
