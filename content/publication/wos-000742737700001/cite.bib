 abstract = {Alien plants represent a significant threat to species diversity and
composition in natural habitats. Nevertheless, little is known about the
dynamic of the invasion process and how its effects on native species
change over time. In this study, we explored vegetation changes that
occurred in invaded coastal dune habitats over the last 10-15 years
(2005-2020), particularly addressing impacts on alien and diagnostic
species. To monitor temporal trends, we used data resulting from a
revisitation study. After detecting overall changes in alien species
occurrence and cover over time, 127 total plots were grouped into plots
experiencing colonization, loss, or persistence of alien species. For
these three categories, we compared historical and resurveyed plots to
quantify changes in native species composition (using the Jaccard
dissimilarity index) and to measure variations in diagnostic species
cover. The number of alien species doubled over time (from 6 to 12) and
two species, Yucca gloriosa and Agave americana, strongly increased
their cover (+5.3% and +11.4%, respectively). Furthermore, plots newly
invaded appeared to record the greatest changes in both native and
diagnostic species. Our results suggest the need for regular monitoring
actions to better understand invasion processes over time and to
implement effective management strategies in invaded coastal dune
habitats.},
