abstract: Alien plants represent a significant threat to species diversity and composition
  in natural habitats. Nevertheless, little is known about the dynamic of the invasion
  process and how its effects on native species change over time. In this study, we
  explored vegetation changes that occurred in invaded coastal dune habitats over
  the last 10-15 years (2005-2020), particularly addressing impacts on alien and diagnostic
  species. To monitor temporal trends, we used data resulting from a revisitation
  study. After detecting overall changes in alien species occurrence and cover over
  time, 127 total plots were grouped into plots experiencing colonization, loss, or
  persistence of alien species. For these three categories, we compared historical
  and resurveyed plots to quantify changes in native species composition (using the
  Jaccard dissimilarity index) and to measure variations in diagnostic species cover.
  The number of alien species doubled over time (from 6 to 12) and two species, Yucca
  gloriosa and Agave americana, strongly increased their cover (+5.3% and +11.4%,
  respectively). Furthermore, plots newly invaded appeared to record the greatest
  changes in both native and diagnostic species. Our results suggest the need for
  regular monitoring actions to better understand invasion processes over time and
  to implement effective management strategies in invaded coastal dune habitats.
