abstract: Coastal erosion, in combination with sea-level rise and extreme meteorological
  events, is globally threatening the biodiversity and functioning of dune ecosystems,
  along with the essential ecosystem services they provide. In this study, by quantifying
  the intensity of erosion and accretion processes occurred over two decades in a
  wide Mediterranean dune system, we explore the influence of sand processes on dune
  plant communities focusing on a large portion of the sea-inland gradient. In particular,
  using different regression techniques, we assess how erosion and accretion processes
  affect richness, cover and diversity of Mediterranean coastal dune plant communities.
  Results show that the influence of coastal erosion and accretion varies along the
  sea-inland gradient, with foreseeable consequences on the integrity of dune systems.
  The negative effect of erosion seems to be particularly marked on foredunes, which
  play a key role in dune formation, while decreasing in landward communities. On
  the other hand, accretion features an opposite trend, unexpectedly influencing only
  Mediterranean shrubs. We highlight the importance of monitoring the effects of erosion
  and accretion processes on coastal vegetation in order to support the conservation
  of dune habitats and preserve the associated ecosystem services, especially in the
  context of climate and human-induced changes.
