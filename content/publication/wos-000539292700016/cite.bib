 abstract = {Coastal erosion, in combination with sea-level rise and extreme
meteorological events, is globally threatening the biodiversity and
functioning of dune ecosystems, along with the essential ecosystem
services they provide. In this study, by quantifying the intensity of
erosion and accretion processes occurred over two decades in a wide
Mediterranean dune system, we explore the influence of sand processes on
dune plant communities focusing on a large portion of the sea-inland
gradient. In particular, using different regression techniques, we
assess how erosion and accretion processes affect richness, cover and
diversity of Mediterranean coastal dune plant communities. Results show
that the influence of coastal erosion and accretion varies along the
sea-inland gradient, with foreseeable consequences on the integrity of
dune systems. The negative effect of erosion seems to be particularly
marked on foredunes, which play a key role in dune formation, while
decreasing in landward communities. On the other hand, accretion
features an opposite trend, unexpectedly influencing only Mediterranean
shrubs. We highlight the importance of monitoring the effects of erosion
and accretion processes on coastal vegetation in order to support the
conservation of dune habitats and preserve the associated ecosystem
services, especially in the context of climate and human-induced
changes.},
