 abstract = {In light of the global biodiversity loss, syntheses of the available
knowledge about drivers of biodiversity are becoming increasingly
important. However, despite the high number of studies analyzing
patterns of plant species diversity, few attempts have been made to
synthesize findings within different ecosystems. In this work, the
relative role of a wide set of predictors imputable to three
conceptual-methodological domains (abiotic, human-mediated disturbance
and landscape domain, hereafter AD, DD and LD) was simultaneously
analyzed in 644 random plots distributed along the coastal dunes of
Central Italy. Native species richness and focal species cover, both
field-recorded, were used as response variables. Predictors pertaining
to the three domains were derived from both field surveys and
high-resolution remotely sensed imagery (LiDAR and orthophotos). To test
how AD, DD and LD affect native species richness and focal species
cover, a GLM and a linear model were fitted respectively. The three
domains were then ranked according to their relative importance.
Although the role of the three domains was always significant, they
turned out to unequally contribute to the explanation of native species
richness and focal species cover patterns. For Mediterranean coastal
dune ecosystems, AD appears to be the key biodiversity driver, followed
by DD and LD. Our results suggest that as long as human disturbance is
limited, plant diversity will distribute according to species abiotic
tolerances, regardless of habitat loss and fragmentation per se.
Representing a first effort towards a synthesis of plant diversity
drivers in coastal dunes, this work points to the importance, in
Mediterranean coastal dune ecosystems, of zonation dynamics, whose
occurrence should be addressed as a priority issue by efficient
conservations strategies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
