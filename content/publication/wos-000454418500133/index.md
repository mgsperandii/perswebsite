abstract: In light of the global biodiversity loss, syntheses of the available knowledge
  about drivers of biodiversity are becoming increasingly important. However, despite
  the high number of studies analyzing patterns of plant species diversity, few attempts
  have been made to synthesize findings within different ecosystems. In this work,
  the relative role of a wide set of predictors imputable to three conceptual-methodological
  domains (abiotic, human-mediated disturbance and landscape domain, hereafter AD,
  DD and LD) was simultaneously analyzed in 644 random plots distributed along the
  coastal dunes of Central Italy. Native species richness and focal species cover,
  both field-recorded, were used as response variables. Predictors pertaining to the
  three domains were derived from both field surveys and high-resolution remotely
  sensed imagery (LiDAR and orthophotos). To test how AD, DD and LD affect native
  species richness and focal species cover, a GLM and a linear model were fitted respectively.
  The three domains were then ranked according to their relative importance. Although
  the role of the three domains was always significant, they turned out to unequally
  contribute to the explanation of native species richness and focal species cover
  patterns. For Mediterranean coastal dune ecosystems, AD appears to be the key biodiversity
  driver, followed by DD and LD. Our results suggest that as long as human disturbance
  is limited, plant diversity will distribute according to species abiotic tolerances,
  regardless of habitat loss and fragmentation per se. Representing a first effort
  towards a synthesis of plant diversity drivers in coastal dunes, this work points
  to the importance, in Mediterranean coastal dune ecosystems, of zonation dynamics,
  whose occurrence should be addressed as a priority issue by efficient conservations
  strategies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
