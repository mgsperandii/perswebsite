abstract: 'Though protected areas are recognized as the cornerstone of global conservation
  efforts, their effectiveness in safeguarding biodiversity is currently debated.
  In particular, studies evaluating the counterfactual influence of protection status
  on community metrics derived from field-collected data are still scarce. In this
  paper, using data from a resurveying study, we assessed the contribution of the
  European Natura 2000 network to maintaining and/or improving through time habitat
  quality and functional integrity in Mediterranean coastal dune habitats, which appear
  among the most threatened ecosystems worldwide. Using multiple regression techniques,
  we tested the influence of protection status on habitat loss and on 10-15 years
  changes in the richness and cover of two highly informative plant groups: focal
  and alien species. Next to a substantial habitat loss, we observed an overall decrease
  in focal species richness and cover, whereas alien species were stable or slightly
  increasing, depending on the habitat. Surprisingly, changes in the analyzed metrics
  did not differ between protected and non-protected sites, thus providing no substantial
  evidence of the effectiveness of Natura 2000 in conserving and/or improving dune
  habitats. Taken together, such results suggest negative implications for the whole
  ecosystem structure and functionality, to be expected regardless of the protection
  status. This led us to reflect about the general inadequacy in the implementation
  of actual conservation measures in coastal habitats, discuss potential causes (lack
  of ad-hoc management plans and targeted conservation measures, scarcity of dedicated
  funding, bureaucratization), and stress the value of monitoring activities for evaluating
  conservation outcomes and reformulating current strategies.'
