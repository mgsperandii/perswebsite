 abstract = {We introduce RanVegDunes (GIVD ID EU-IT-020), the first Italian database
gathering standardized, randomly -sampled vegetation data in coastal
dune environments. RanVegDunes currently consists of 979 original
georeferenced releves randomly collected over about 160 km of Holocenic
dune systems of central Italy between 2002 and 2015. Plots were located
in five Italian administrative regions (Lazio, Campania, Abruzzo, Molise
and Puglia), where sandy vegetation was randomly recorded in
standardized 4-m(2) plots across the whole coastal zonation, thus
including upper beach, embryo dunes, shifting dunes, dune grasslands,
wooded dunes and Mediterranean forests. Each plot was georeferenced with
a high level of accuracy using a GPS unit. For each plot, a list of
vascular plant species based on updated nomenclature was compiled, and
an estimate of abundance was calculated for each species using a
percentage cover scale ranging from 1 to 10 (1 = 1-10%; 2 = 10-20%;
...; 10 = 90-100%). Two habitat classification systems were used for
the description of collected plots: specifically, each vegetation plot
was classified according to the Interpretation Manual of the 92/43/EEC
Habitats Directive and also to the hierarchical structure of the EUNIS
habitat classification. Currently, RanVegDunes includes vegetation plots
belonging to nine EU Habitats (1210, 2110, 2120, 2210, 2230, 2250, 2260,
2270, 9340), which in turn correspond to five EUNIS Habitats (B1.1,
B1.3, B1.4, B1.6, B1.7). RanVegDunes is a powerful tool for a variety of
studies addressing topics such as temporal trends in coastal vegetation,
ecological modeling, re-visitation studies, spatio-temporal patterns of
invasion and will therefore greatly benefit from further collection of
data.},
