 abstract = {Increasing urbanization worldwide calls for more sustainable urban
development. Simultaneously, the global biodiversity crisis accentuates
the need of fostering biodiversity within cities. Policies supporting
urban nature conservation need to understand people's acceptance of
biodiversity-friendly greenspace management. We surveyed more than 2,000
people in 19 European cities about their attitudes toward near-natural
urban grassland management in public greenspaces, and related their
responses to nine sociocultural parameters. Results reveal that people
across Europe can support urban biodiversity, yet within the frames of a
generally tidy appearance of public greenery. Younger people and those
using greenspaces for a greater variety of activities were more likely
to favor biodiversity-friendly greenspace management. Additionally,
people who were aware of the meaning of biodiversity and those stating
responsibility for biodiversity conservation particularly supported
biodiversity-friendly greenspace management. Our results point at
explicit measures like environmental education to increase public
acceptance of policies that facilitate nature conservation within
cities.},
