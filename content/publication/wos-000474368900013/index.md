abstract: 'Secondary dry grasslands in Europe can host high levels of vascular plant
  richness at small spatial scales. However, in Southern Europe their biodiversity
  patterns are largely unexplored. In this work, we aim at: (i) estimating plant species
  richness patterns at very fine scales in montane dry grasslands, on limestone bedrock,
  in Abruzzo Lazio and Molise National Park (Central Apennines, Italy); (ii) assessing
  the most important physical and edaphic drivers of biodiversity patterns at multiple
  plot sizes. We used randomly placed nested-plot series where we measured alpha-diversity
  at three different plot sizes (1m(2), 0.1m(2) and 0.01m(2)) and within-plot beta-diversity
  (as expressed by the slope of the species-area curve across plot sizes). Variable
  selection was performed by means of Random Forests. Relationships between selected
  variables and diversity measures were then assessed using Regression Trees, Linear
  and Generalized Linear Models. Overall, results pointed to topographically-controlled
  edaphic factors (soil pH and silt fraction) as the main drivers positively influencing
  alpha-diversity at all spatial scales, with a positive effect of rock cover and
  slope inclination at smaller spatial grains. Beta-diversity was positively influenced
  by rock cover. We suggest that high-pH, steep and/or rocky sites feature higher
  species richness because they lack competitive grass species. Our results are in
  agreement with previous works underlining the importance of less productive habitats
  for the conservation of secondary grassland biodiversity.'
