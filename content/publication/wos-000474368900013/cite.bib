 abstract = {Secondary dry grasslands in Europe can host high levels of vascular
plant richness at small spatial scales. However, in Southern Europe
their biodiversity patterns are largely unexplored. In this work, we aim
at: (i) estimating plant species richness patterns at very fine scales
in montane dry grasslands, on limestone bedrock, in Abruzzo Lazio and
Molise National Park (Central Apennines, Italy); (ii) assessing the most
important physical and edaphic drivers of biodiversity patterns at
multiple plot sizes. We used randomly placed nested-plot series where we
measured alpha-diversity at three different plot sizes (1m(2), 0.1m(2)
and 0.01m(2)) and within-plot beta-diversity (as expressed by the slope
of the species-area curve across plot sizes). Variable selection was
performed by means of Random Forests. Relationships between selected
variables and diversity measures were then assessed using Regression
Trees, Linear and Generalized Linear Models. Overall, results pointed to
topographically-controlled edaphic factors (soil pH and silt fraction)
as the main drivers positively influencing alpha-diversity at all
spatial scales, with a positive effect of rock cover and slope
inclination at smaller spatial grains. Beta-diversity was positively
influenced by rock cover. We suggest that high-pH, steep and/or rocky
sites feature higher species richness because they lack competitive
grass species. Our results are in agreement with previous works
underlining the importance of less productive habitats for the
conservation of secondary grassland biodiversity.},
