 abstract = {Coastal areas harbor the most threatened ecosystems on Earth, and
cost-effective ways to monitor and protect them are urgently needed, but
they represent a challenge for habitat mapping and multi-temporal
observations. The availability of open access, remotely sensed data with
increasing spatial and spectral resolution is promising in this context.
Thus, in a sector of the Mediterranean coast (Lazio region, Italy), we
tested the strength of a phenology-based vegetation mapping approach and
statistically compared results with previous studies, making use of open
source products across all the processing chain. We identified five
accurate land cover classes in three hierarchical levels, with good
values of agreement with previous studies for the first and the second
hierarchical level. The implemented procedure resulted as being
effective for mapping a highly fragmented coastal dune system. This is
encouraging to take advantage of the earth observation through remote
sensing technology in an open source perspective, even at the fine scale
of highly fragmented sand dunes landscapes.},
