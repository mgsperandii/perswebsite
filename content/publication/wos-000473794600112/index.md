abstract: Coastal areas harbor the most threatened ecosystems on Earth, and cost-effective
  ways to monitor and protect them are urgently needed, but they represent a challenge
  for habitat mapping and multi-temporal observations. The availability of open access,
  remotely sensed data with increasing spatial and spectral resolution is promising
  in this context. Thus, in a sector of the Mediterranean coast (Lazio region, Italy),
  we tested the strength of a phenology-based vegetation mapping approach and statistically
  compared results with previous studies, making use of open source products across
  all the processing chain. We identified five accurate land cover classes in three
  hierarchical levels, with good values of agreement with previous studies for the
  first and the second hierarchical level. The implemented procedure resulted as being
  effective for mapping a highly fragmented coastal dune system. This is encouraging
  to take advantage of the earth observation through remote sensing technology in
  an open source perspective, even at the fine scale of highly fragmented sand dunes
  landscapes.
