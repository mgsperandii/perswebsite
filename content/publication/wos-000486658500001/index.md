abstract: Festuca valesiaca Schleich. ex Gaudin subsp. valesiaca is acknowledged as
  one of the most characteristic grasses of the continental grasslands and steppes
  of Eurasia. In Italy, the species was known almost only from the continental valleys
  of the Alpine chain (with the exception of two small populations at the northernmost
  edge of the Apennines). Here, we report on the first confirmed finding of F. valesiaca
  subsp. valesiaca in the surroundings of the Fucino Basin, Central Apennines. This
  finding expands by c. 400 km southwards the species' range in Italy. The identity
  of the species was first ascertained by means of leaf cross-sections and stomata
  measurements, and then confirmed by chromosome count. Its habitat preferences within
  the area were found to match well with those described in the literature for C-Europe.
  After discussing some identification issues and the population's ecological niche,
  we present the main biogeographic implications of our finding. By recalling and
  discussing similar examples, we conclude that during the Holocene forest spread
  some Apennine ``dry valleys″ performed as refugia for a number of Pleistocene steppic
  taxa. The grasslands of these areas may thus be ancient and valuable ecosystems
  maintained by climate and disturbance throughout the Holocene.
