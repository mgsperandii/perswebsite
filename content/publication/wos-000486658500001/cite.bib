 abstract = {Festuca valesiaca Schleich. ex Gaudin subsp. valesiaca is acknowledged
as one of the most characteristic grasses of the continental grasslands
and steppes of Eurasia. In Italy, the species was known almost only from
the continental valleys of the Alpine chain (with the exception of two
small populations at the northernmost edge of the Apennines). Here, we
report on the first confirmed finding of F. valesiaca subsp. valesiaca
in the surroundings of the Fucino Basin, Central Apennines. This finding
expands by c. 400 km southwards the species' range in Italy. The
identity of the species was first ascertained by means of leaf
cross-sections and stomata measurements, and then confirmed by
chromosome count. Its habitat preferences within the area were found to
match well with those described in the literature for C-Europe. After
discussing some identification issues and the population's ecological
niche, we present the main biogeographic implications of our finding. By
recalling and discussing similar examples, we conclude that during the
Holocene forest spread some Apennine ``dry valleys″ performed as
refugia for a number of Pleistocene steppic taxa. The grasslands of
these areas may thus be ancient and valuable ecosystems maintained by
climate and disturbance throughout the Holocene.},
