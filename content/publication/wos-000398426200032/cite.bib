 abstract = {Plant diversity measures (e.g., alpha- and beta-diversity) provide the
basis for a number of ecological indication and monitoring methods.
These measures are based on species counts in sampling units (plots or
quadrats). However, there are two alternative conventions for defining a
vascular plant species as "present" in a plot, i.e. "shoot presence" (a species is recorded if the vertical projection of any
above-ground part falls within the plot) and "rooted presence" (a
species is recorded only when an individual is rooted inside the plot).
Very few studies addressed the effects of the two sampling conventions
on species richness and diversity indices. We sampled mountain dry
grasslands in Italy across different plot sizes and vegetation types to
assess how large is the difference in alpha- and beta-diversity values
and in sample based rarefaction curves between the two methods. We found
that the difference is greatly dependent on plot size, being more
relevant, both in absolute and percentage values, at smaller grain; it
is also dependent on habitat type, being larger in shallow-soil
communities, as they have a sparser vegetation structure and host
life-form types with a larger lateral spread. At fine spatial scales (<1
m(2)) the difference is large enough to bias statistical inference, and
we conclude that at such scales one should not attempt to compare plant
diversity indices if they were not obtained with the same sampling
convention. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
