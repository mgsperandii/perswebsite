abstract: Plant diversity measures (e.g., alpha- and beta-diversity) provide the basis
  for a number of ecological indication and monitoring methods. These measures are
  based on species counts in sampling units (plots or quadrats). However, there are
  two alternative conventions for defining a vascular plant species as "present"
  in a plot, i.e. "shoot presence" (a species is recorded if the vertical projection
  of any above-ground part falls within the plot) and "rooted presence" (a species
  is recorded only when an individual is rooted inside the plot). Very few studies
  addressed the effects of the two sampling conventions on species richness and diversity
  indices. We sampled mountain dry grasslands in Italy across different plot sizes
  and vegetation types to assess how large is the difference in alpha- and beta-diversity
  values and in sample based rarefaction curves between the two methods. We found
  that the difference is greatly dependent on plot size, being more relevant, both
  in absolute and percentage values, at smaller grain; it is also dependent on habitat
  type, being larger in shallow-soil communities, as they have a sparser vegetation
  structure and host life-form types with a larger lateral spread. At fine spatial
  scales (<1 m(2)) the difference is large enough to bias statistical inference, and
  we conclude that at such scales one should not attempt to compare plant diversity
  indices if they were not obtained with the same sampling convention. (C) 2016 Elsevier
