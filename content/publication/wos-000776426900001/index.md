abstract: Analysing temporal patterns in plant communities is extremely important
  to quantify the extent and the consequences of ecological changes, especially considering
  the current biodiversity crisis. Long-term data collected through the regular sampling
  of permanent plots represent the most accurate resource to study ecological succession,
  analyse the stability of a community over time and understand the mechanisms driving
  vegetation change. We hereby present the LOng-Term Vegetation Sampling (LOTVS) initiative,
  a global collection of vegetation time-series derived from the regular monitoring
  of plant species in permanent plots. With 79 data sets from five continents and
  7,789 vegetation time-series monitored for at least 6 years and mostly on an annual
  basis, LOTVS possibly represents the largest collection of temporally fine-grained
  vegetation time-series derived from permanent plots and made accessible to the research
  community. As such, it has an outstanding potential to support innovative research
  in the fields of vegetation science, plant ecology and temporal ecology.
