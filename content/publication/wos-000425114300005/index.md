abstract: Multi-year temporal studies are invaluable tools for monitoring changes
  in biodiversity through time. However, their applications in coastal ecosystems
  are still scarce. We investigated temporal trends in coastal dunes analyzing a set
  of 858 randomly-sampled georeferenced relev,s performed between 2002 and 2015 along
  Central Italy's sandy coastlines. Specifically, we explored changes in species richness
  and cover of targeted sandy habitats, we investigated trends in the cover of selected
  psammophilous native species and we assessed patterns of invasion by means of regression
  techniques. We observed a significant decrease in species richness and cover of
  the dune grasslands habitat. The species-level analysis confirmed a negative trend
  for two characteristic species of dune grasslands, Cutandia maritima and Medicago
  littoralis, while revealing a similar decline for Crucianella maritima and for Ammophila
  arenaria subsp. australis, key species of mobile dunes. The most striking trends
  emerged analyzing patterns in the cover of an invasive alien species, Carpobrotus
  sp., which showed a concerning increase in shifting dunes. In conclusion, our analyses
  reveal concerning changes involving dune grasslands, and at the same time hint at
  ``early warningsâ€³ of degradation processes traceable in shifting dunes.
