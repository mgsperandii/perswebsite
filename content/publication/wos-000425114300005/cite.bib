 abstract = {Multi-year temporal studies are invaluable tools for monitoring changes
in biodiversity through time. However, their applications in coastal
ecosystems are still scarce. We investigated temporal trends in coastal
dunes analyzing a set of 858 randomly-sampled georeferenced relev,s
performed between 2002 and 2015 along Central Italy's sandy coastlines.
Specifically, we explored changes in species richness and cover of
targeted sandy habitats, we investigated trends in the cover of selected
psammophilous native species and we assessed patterns of invasion by
means of regression techniques. We observed a significant decrease in
species richness and cover of the dune grasslands habitat. The
species-level analysis confirmed a negative trend for two characteristic
species of dune grasslands, Cutandia maritima and Medicago littoralis,
while revealing a similar decline for Crucianella maritima and for
Ammophila arenaria subsp. australis, key species of mobile dunes. The
most striking trends emerged analyzing patterns in the cover of an
invasive alien species, Carpobrotus sp., which showed a concerning
increase in shifting dunes. In conclusion, our analyses reveal
concerning changes involving dune grasslands, and at the same time hint
at ``early warningsâ€³ of degradation processes traceable in shifting
dunes.},
