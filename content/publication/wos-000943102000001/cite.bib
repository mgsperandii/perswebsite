Title = {Ecology meets archaeology: Past, present and future vegetation-derived
   ecosystems services from the Nuragic Sardinia (1700-580 BCE)},
Journal = {PEOPLE AND NATURE},
Abstract = {Incorporating archaeology within the ecosystem services (ES) framework
   can offer decision-makers lessons from the past and a broader
   sustainability perspective. Given the claimed archaeology-ES link, the
   island of Sardinia (Italy) offers an unparalleled opportunity where a
   unique archaeological heritage occurs in an area of high biodiversity
   value. More than 5000 nuraghi, megalithic edifices distinctive of the
   Nuragic civilization (1700-580 BCE), are still present on the island. By
   crossing the map of Vegetation Series (VS) with nuraghi occurrences, we
   aimed at acquiring a long-term perspective on the interactions between
   Nuragic people and the vegetation as ES provider, so as to enrich our
   understanding of the past and the present, and potentially inform future
   practice for the region of Sardinia. A VS is here intended as a
   hypothesis of a succession of plant communities that can potentially
   succeed each other over time in a particular land unit. The
   vegetation-derived ES represented a driving force in the land occupation
   strategies of the Nuragic people, who preferred, for their settlements,
   the mesophiluos cork oak VS and secondary the deciduous broad-leaved
   ones, which, with fresh climatic conditions on fertile substrates and
   gentle slopes on effusive magmatic rocks, can provide land for grazing
   and agriculture. Conversely, the Nuragic land occupation strategies
   shaped the VS, transforming the landscape into agro-silvo-pastoral
   systems. Our results suggest that the origin of the present
   agro-silvo-pastoral landscapes (i.e. Pascolo arborato/Dehesa) in
   Sardinia could be traced back to the Nuragic civilization. The
   interaction between humans and vegetation in Sardinia is ancient,
   reciprocal and dynamic. This interaction is crucial for the survival of
   the present agro-silvo-pastoral landscapes that represent important
   suppliers of provisioning, regulating and cultural ES. Among others,
   these landscapes are a good example of intimate and sustainable
   relationships between people and nature and provide a marked sense of
   place and identity for Sardinia inhabitants. This transdisciplinary
   approach linking plant ecology with archaeology offered archaeology a
   better understanding of the environmental settings and subsistence of
   the Nuragic civilization and provided plant ecology with a long-term
   perspective on human-vegetation interactions. Read the free Plain
