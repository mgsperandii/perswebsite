 abstract = {With the aim to identify future challenges and opportunities in
vegetation science, we brought together a group of 22 early career
vegetation scientists from diverse backgrounds to perform a horizon
scan. In this contribution, we present a selection of 15 topics that
were ranked by participants as the most emergent and impactful for
vegetation science in the face of global change. We highlight
methodological tools that we expect will play a critical role in
resolving emerging issues by providing ways to unveil new aspects of
plant community dynamics and structure. These tools include next
generation sequencing, plant spectral imaging, process-based species
distribution models, resurveying studies and permanent plots. Further,
we stress the need to integrate long-term monitoring, the study of novel
ecosystems, below-ground traits, pollination interactions and global
networks of near-surface microclimate data at fine spatio-temporal
resolutions to fully understand and predict the impacts of climate
change on vegetation dynamics. We also emphasize the need to integrate
traditional forms of knowledge and a diversity of stakeholders into
research, teaching, management and policy-making to advance the field of
vegetation science. The conclusions reached by this horizon scan
naturally reflect the background, expertise and interests of a
representative pool of early career vegetation scientists, which should
serve as basis for future developments in the field.},
