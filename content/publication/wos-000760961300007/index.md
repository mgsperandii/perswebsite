abstract: With the aim to identify future challenges and opportunities in vegetation
  science, we brought together a group of 22 early career vegetation scientists from
  diverse backgrounds to perform a horizon scan. In this contribution, we present
  a selection of 15 topics that were ranked by participants as the most emergent and
  impactful for vegetation science in the face of global change. We highlight methodological
  tools that we expect will play a critical role in resolving emerging issues by providing
  ways to unveil new aspects of plant community dynamics and structure. These tools
  include next generation sequencing, plant spectral imaging, process-based species
  distribution models, resurveying studies and permanent plots. Further, we stress
  the need to integrate long-term monitoring, the study of novel ecosystems, below-ground
  traits, pollination interactions and global networks of near-surface microclimate
  data at fine spatio-temporal resolutions to fully understand and predict the impacts
  of climate change on vegetation dynamics. We also emphasize the need to integrate
  traditional forms of knowledge and a diversity of stakeholders into research, teaching,
  management and policy-making to advance the field of vegetation science. The conclusions
  reached by this horizon scan naturally reflect the background, expertise and interests
  of a representative pool of early career vegetation scientists, which should serve
  as basis for future developments in the field.
