 abstract = {Pioneering investigations on the effects of introduced populations on
community structure, ecosystem functioning and services have focused on
the effects of invaders on taxonomic diversity. However, taxonomic-based
diversity metrics overlook the heterogeneity of species roles within and
among communities. As the homogenizing effects of biological invasions
on community and ecosystem processes can be subtle, they may require the
use of functional diversity indices to be properly evidenced. Starting
from the listing of major functional diversity indices, alongside the
presentation of their strengths and limitations, we focus on studies
pertaining to the effects of invasive species on native communities and
recipient ecosystems using functional diversity indices. By doing so, we
reveal that functional diversity of the recipient community may strongly
vary at the onset of the invasion process, while it stabilizes at
intermediate and high levels of invasion. As functional changes
occurring during the lag phase of an invasion have been poorly
investigated, we show that it is still unknown whether there are
consistent changes in functional diversity metrics that could indicate
the end of the lag phase. Thus, we recommend providing information on
the invasion stage under consideration when computing functional
diversity metrics. For the existing literature, it is also surprising
that very few studies explored the functional difference between
organisms from the recipient communities and invaders of the same
trophic levels, or assessed the effects of non-native organism
establishment into a non-analogue versus an analogue community. By
providing valuable tools for obtaining in-depth diagnostics of community
structure and functioning, functional diversity indices can be applied
for timely implementation of restoration plans and improved conservation
strategies. To conclude, our work provides a first synthetic guide for
their use in hypothesis testing in invasion biology.},
