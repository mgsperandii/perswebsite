abstract: Pioneering investigations on the effects of introduced populations on community
  structure, ecosystem functioning and services have focused on the effects of invaders
  on taxonomic diversity. However, taxonomic-based diversity metrics overlook the
  heterogeneity of species roles within and among communities. As the homogenizing
  effects of biological invasions on community and ecosystem processes can be subtle,
  they may require the use of functional diversity indices to be properly evidenced.
  Starting from the listing of major functional diversity indices, alongside the presentation
  of their strengths and limitations, we focus on studies pertaining to the effects
  of invasive species on native communities and recipient ecosystems using functional
  diversity indices. By doing so, we reveal that functional diversity of the recipient
  community may strongly vary at the onset of the invasion process, while it stabilizes
  at intermediate and high levels of invasion. As functional changes occurring during
  the lag phase of an invasion have been poorly investigated, we show that it is still
  unknown whether there are consistent changes in functional diversity metrics that
  could indicate the end of the lag phase. Thus, we recommend providing information
  on the invasion stage under consideration when computing functional diversity metrics.
  For the existing literature, it is also surprising that very few studies explored
  the functional difference between organisms from the recipient communities and invaders
  of the same trophic levels, or assessed the effects of non-native organism establishment
  into a non-analogue versus an analogue community. By providing valuable tools for
  obtaining in-depth diagnostics of community structure and functioning, functional
  diversity indices can be applied for timely implementation of restoration plans
  and improved conservation strategies. To conclude, our work provides a first synthetic
  guide for their use in hypothesis testing in invasion biology.
