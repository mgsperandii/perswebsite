abstract: "Grasslands are widespread elements of urban greenspace providing recreational,\
  \ psychological and aesthetic benefits to city residents. Two urban grassland types\
  \ of contrasting management dominate urban greenspaces: frequently mown, species-poor\
  \ short-cut lawns and less intensively managed, near-natural tall-grass meadows.\
  \ The higher conservation value of tall-grass meadows makes management interventions\
  \ such as converting short-cut lawns into tall-grass meadows a promising tool for\
  \ urban biodiversity conservation. The societal success of such interventions, however,\
  \ depends on identifying the values urban residents assign to different types of\
  \ urban grasslands, and how these values translate to attitudes towards greenspace\
  \ management. Using 2027 questionnaires across 19 European cities, we identify the\
  \ assigned values that correlate with people's personal greenspace use and their\
  \ preferences for different types of urban grasslands to determine how these values\
  \ relate to the agreement with a scenario of converting 50% of their cities' short-cut\
  \ lawns into tall-grass meadows. We found that most people assigned nature-related\
  \ values, such as wildness, to tall-grass meadows and utility-related values, such\
  \ as recreation, to short-cut lawns. Positive value associations of wildness and\
  \ species richness with tall-grass meadows, and social and nature related greenspace\
  \ activities, positively correlated with agreeing to convert short-cut lawns into\
  \ tall-grass meadows. Conversely, disapproval of lawn conversion correlated with\
  \ positive value associations of cleanliness and recreation potential with short-cut\
  \ lawns. Here, people using greenspaces for nature-related activities were outstandingly\
  \ positive about lawn conversion. The results show that the plurality of values\
  \ assigned to different types of urban grasslands should be considered in urban\
  \ greenspace planning. For example, tall-grass meadows could be managed to also\
  \ accommodate the values associated with short-cut lawns, such as tidiness and recreation\
  \ potential, to support their societal acceptance. (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published\
