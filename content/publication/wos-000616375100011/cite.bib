 abstract = {Grasslands are widespread elements of urban greenspace providing
recreational, psychological and aesthetic benefits to city residents.
Two urban grassland types of contrasting management dominate urban
greenspaces: frequently mown, species-poor short-cut lawns and less
intensively managed, near-natural tall-grass meadows. The higher
conservation value of tall-grass meadows makes management interventions
such as converting short-cut lawns into tall-grass meadows a promising
tool for urban biodiversity conservation. The societal success of such
interventions, however, depends on identifying the values urban
residents assign to different types of urban grasslands, and how these
values translate to attitudes towards greenspace management. Using 2027
questionnaires across 19 European cities, we identify the assigned
values that correlate with people's personal greenspace use and their
preferences for different types of urban grasslands to determine how
these values relate to the agreement with a scenario of converting 50%
of their cities' short-cut lawns into tall-grass meadows. We found that
most people assigned nature-related values, such as wildness, to
tall-grass meadows and utility-related values, such as recreation, to
short-cut lawns. Positive value associations of wildness and species
richness with tall-grass meadows, and social and nature related
greenspace activities, positively correlated with agreeing to convert
short-cut lawns into tall-grass meadows. Conversely, disapproval of lawn
conversion correlated with positive value associations of cleanliness
and recreation potential with short-cut lawns. Here, people using
greenspaces for nature-related activities were outstandingly positive
about lawn conversion. The results show that the plurality of values
assigned to different types of urban grasslands should be considered in
urban greenspace planning. For example, tall-grass meadows could be
managed to also accommodate the values associated with short-cut lawns,
such as tidiness and recreation potential, to support their societal
acceptance. (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier GmbH on behalf
