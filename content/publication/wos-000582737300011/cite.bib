 abstract = {Small-scale landforms influence plant species richness, but their
mechanisms and effects in semi-natural dry grasslands have been poorly
investigated. In this study we compared vascular plant richness, species
composition, plant traits, soil properties and biomass nutrient content
of convex (hillocks) and concave (hollows) karst landforms in a mountain
pasture of the Central Apennines (Italy), at a small spatial scale (1
m(2) plots). We found hillocks had significantly higher species richness
than hol-lows. On hillocks, smaller Specific Leaf Area and Lateral
Width, together with greater allocation of resources to Below-Ground
Organs, indicated lower water availability, whereas hollows had deeper
(thus moister), more acidic and more fertile soils, with aboveground
plant biomass displaying higher nutrient levels. Partial correlation and
regression tree models suggested that fine scale richness patterns were
not directly determined by abiotic properties, but were rather the
result of competition levels associated with the cover of Agrostis
capillaris (=A. tenuis) a calcifuge and drought-sensitive grass able to
achieve dominance only in hollows. The higher functional convergence
exhibited by hollows suggests that A. capillaris is a strong competitor
both aboveand below-ground, mediating the effects of topography by
imposing a biotic filter. On hillocks, competition is released by lower
levels of available soil water in summer and higher soil pH, resulting
in higher species richness and a more function-ally divergent
assemblage. (C) 2020 Gesellschaft fur okologie. Published by Elsevier
