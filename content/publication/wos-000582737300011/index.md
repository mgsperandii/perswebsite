abstract: Small-scale landforms influence plant species richness, but their mechanisms
  and effects in semi-natural dry grasslands have been poorly investigated. In this
  study we compared vascular plant richness, species composition, plant traits, soil
  properties and biomass nutrient content of convex (hillocks) and concave (hollows)
  karst landforms in a mountain pasture of the Central Apennines (Italy), at a small
  spatial scale (1 m(2) plots). We found hillocks had significantly higher species
  richness than hol-lows. On hillocks, smaller Specific Leaf Area and Lateral Width,
  together with greater allocation of resources to Below-Ground Organs, indicated
  lower water availability, whereas hollows had deeper (thus moister), more acidic
  and more fertile soils, with aboveground plant biomass displaying higher nutrient
  levels. Partial correlation and regression tree models suggested that fine scale
  richness patterns were not directly determined by abiotic properties, but were rather
  the result of competition levels associated with the cover of Agrostis capillaris
  (=A. tenuis) a calcifuge and drought-sensitive grass able to achieve dominance only
  in hollows. The higher functional convergence exhibited by hollows suggests that
  A. capillaris is a strong competitor both aboveand below-ground, mediating the effects
  of topography by imposing a biotic filter. On hillocks, competition is released
  by lower levels of available soil water in summer and higher soil pH, resulting
  in higher species richness and a more function-ally divergent assemblage. (C) 2020
