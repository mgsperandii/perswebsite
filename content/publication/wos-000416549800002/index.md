abstract: Astragalus exscapus L. subsp. exscapus (Fabaceae) is a rare and declining
  perennial herb with a very fragmented distribution range. It is interpreted as a
  relict of the glacial steppe flora. In Italy, it was known until now only from the
  Alpine "dry valleys", namely from Val d'Aosta and Val Venosta/Vinschgau. We report
  on the discovery of a population on the slopes of the Fucino basin in the Central
  Apennines (Abruzzo, Italy). The finding significantly expands the known species
  range (the site is > 600 km away from the nearest known populations), suggesting
  that during Pleistocene steppic phases it had a wide distribution across Europe.
  A. exscapus adds to a number of other steppic relicts found in the Fucino basin,
  highlighting that some inner valleys of the Central Apennines, featuring a relatively
  continental climate, perform as "interglacial refugiaâ€³ for the steppe flora. Further
  research is needed to ascertain the species' local distribution and abundance, and
  to clarify its vicariance history; however, the finding underlines the need to re-evaluate
  priorities in landscape management, as in the Apennines dry grasslands are often
  given low values compared to forests and are frequently destroyed by afforestation
  practices with non-native conifers.
