 abstract = {Astragalus exscapus L. subsp. exscapus (Fabaceae) is a rare and
declining perennial herb with a very fragmented distribution range.
It is interpreted as a relict of the glacial steppe flora. In Italy, it was
known until now only from the Alpine "dry valleys", namely from Val
d'Aosta and Val Venosta/Vinschgau. We report on the discovery of a
population on the slopes of the Fucino basin in the Central Apennines
(Abruzzo, Italy). The finding significantly expands the known species
range (the site is > 600 km away from the nearest known populations),
suggesting that during Pleistocene steppic phases it had a wide
distribution across Europe. A. exscapus adds to a number of other
steppic relicts found in the Fucino basin, highlighting that some inner
valleys of the Central Apennines, featuring a relatively continental
climate, perform as "interglacial refugiaâ€³ for the steppe flora.
Further research is needed to ascertain the species' local distribution
and abundance, and to clarify its vicariance history; however, the
finding underlines the need to re-evaluate priorities in landscape
management, as in the Apennines dry grasslands are often given low
values compared to forests and are frequently destroyed by afforestation
practices with non-native conifers.},
