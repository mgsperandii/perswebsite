Great news! :tada::partying_face:

Since December 2022, I am part of the Editorial Review Board of the [Journal of Vegetation Science](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/16541103)!

Focusing on all aspects of plant community ecology, _Journal of Vegetation Science_ publishes papers on any aspect related to vegetation science, including community structure, biodiversity, spatial patterns, temporal changes (including demography, community dynamics and palaeoecology) and processes (including ecophysiology).

JVS is the official organ of the [International Association for Vegetation Science](https://www.iavs.org), a worldwide union of scientists and others interested in theoretical and practical studies of vegetation. Together with its sister journals [Applied Vegetation Science](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1654109x) and [Vegetation Classification and Survey](https://vcs.pensoft.net), it is a leading publishing outlet for vegetation scientists :earth_americas:around the world :earth_asia:.
