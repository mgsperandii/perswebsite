## Overview
I am very new to blogging, so I thought I'd start with an introductory post.

I am a vegetation scientist broadly interested in biodiversity monitoring. My main research focus is the multi-faceted analysis of patterns and drivers of temporal vegetation change, but I am also interested in evaluating the effectiveness of protected areas in maintaining and/or improving the conservation status of EU habitats.

So far, I have been mostly working in Mediterranean coastal dunes and dry grassland.

I am particularly involved in the [International Association for Vegetation Science](https://www.iavs.org/default.aspx). Between 2019 and 2021 I served in the Steering Committee of the [Young Scientists](https://www.iavs.org/page/working-groups_young-scientists) working group, and I am currently chair of the [Ecoinformatics](https://www.iavs.org/page/working-groups_ecoinformatics) working group. I am also a member of the Italian Society for Vegetation Science and of the Italian Chapter of the Society for Conservation Biology.

I am also part of the [LOTVS](https://lotvs.csic.es) initiative, a global collection of permanent vegetation plots.
