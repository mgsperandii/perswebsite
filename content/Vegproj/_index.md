**VegTrends** is a research project funded under the **2021 "HORIZON.4.1 - Widening participation and spreading excellence"** call. Making use of the recently assembled [ReSurveyEurope](http://euroveg.org/eva-database-re-survey-europe) database, VegTrends will produce a comprehensive and representative report of temporal trends in the vegetation of European open habitats. Specific objectives (O) addressed through two work packages (WPs) are:
- [ ] assessing temporal trends in the vegetation of open European habitats
- [ ] evaluating the effectiveness of protected areas (Natura2000 + Emerald Network) in conserving the vegetation of open European habitats

More information, as well as a summary available in six languages, can be found on the project's webpage on [Cordis](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101090344). To develop VegTrends, I will spend the next two years at the [Department of Botany and Zoology](https://botzool.sci.muni.cz/en) of the vibrant [Masaryk University](https://www.muni.cz/en), where I will be supervised by [Milan Chytr√Ω](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=scnnn1UAAAAJ&hl=en).
