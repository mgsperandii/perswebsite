#_VegTrends is a research project funded under the 2021 "HORIZON.4.1 - Widening participation and spreading excellence" call._

Across most of the globe, ecosystems are being transformed, degraded and fragmented. [In Europe, more than 30% of terrestrial habitats have been assessed as "threatened"](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/22542b64-c501-11e7-9b01-01aa75ed71a1/language-en), and the extent to which existing protected areas effectively safeguard biodiversity is currently debated. Halting biodiversity loss, ensuring current and future provisioning of its associated benefits, and protecting natural habitats are core priorities of worldwide conservation agendas, e.g. the UN Sustainable Development Goals or the EU 2030 Biodiversity Strategy. To achieve these goals, assessments of biodiversity changes through time are essential, especially if accounting for multiple diversity facets and for different levels of biological organization.

[Resurvey studies of vegetation](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/avsc.12269), based on the re- sampling of historically surveyed vegetation plots, are increasingly used as a cost-effective means to detect temporal changes across many ecosystems. The recent availability of long-term vegetation datasets spanning across large geographical areas and multiple ecosystems offers an unprecedented opportunity to quantify biodiversity change efficiently and across previously intractable spatial extents.

VegTrends aims at producing a comprehensive and representative report of temporal vegetation trends in European open habitats. Specific objectives, addressed through two working packages (WPs) are: i) providing a multi-habitat assessment of temporal vegetation changes accounting for multiple diversity facets (taxonomic, functional, phylogenetic) and different biological levels (community and species); ii) evaluating the effectiveness of protected areas in conserving European habitats. To do so, VegTrends will make use of [ReSurveyEurope](https://euroveg.org/resurvey/), a unique database of long-term vegetation time-series derived from resurvey studies. This will allow gaining unique insights into the temporal trends of European vegetation and assessing risks for individual habitats.
