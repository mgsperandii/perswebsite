Due to their unique features, coastal dunes are listed among the most interesting ecosystems on earth. However, they are currently exposed to a number of threats globally affecting their conservation status. In the Mediterranean region, uncontrolled urbanization and population growth characterizing the last 70 years led to a progressive deterioration of coastal dune ecosystems and to a severe reduction in their extent. Several European coastal dune habitats have been recently assessed by the Red List of European Habitats as either endangered or vulnerable, and their conservation status in Italy largely reflects the European picture. Identifying the most endangered habitats and monitoring their dynamics are key research tasks that cannot be further procrastinated, if we want to avoid a complete disappearance of these ecosystems in the near future. In this study, I provided a comprehensive assessment of temporal changes characterizing Mediterranean coastal dune habitats in the last 10-15 years by using different approaches (a diachronic analysis of a random-plot database and a resurveying study), analyzing multiple dimensions of diversity (i.e. taxonomic and functional), and investigating multiple levels of biological organization (i.e. community and species).
I started by performing a diachronic analysis of a large database of random, standardized, georeferenced plots. Using linear and generalized linear models I explored temporal trends in species richness and cover of targeted sandy habitats, investigated trends in the cover of selected psammophilous native species and assessed temporal patterns of invasion. This diachronic analysis revealed concerning changes involving dune grasslands, where a negative trend in species richness and habitat cover emerged. At the same time, results hinted at ‘‘early warnings’’ of degradation processes in shifting dunes, where a decline in the cover of the sand-binding Ammophila arenaria subsp. australis, and a parallel increase in the cover of Carpobrotus sp. were recorded.
Then, I planned a large resurveying study which led me to revisit and resample 334 plots belonging to the first portion of coastal zonation (from the upper beach to coastal dune grasslands) in the course of two sampling seasons.
With the data collected during my first sampling season I tested the effectiveness of resurveying approaches based on quasi-permanent plots in revealing temporal changes in herbaceous communities of Mediterranean coastal dune systems. In particular, I quantified compositional shifts using Sørensen index of dissimilarity, I applied a partitioning method to determine whether observed change was driven by species turnover or by a “nestedness” effect, and I analyzed changes in the occurrence and cover of diagnostic species of the investigated habitats. Together with the disappearance of about 25% of historical plots, results revealed major transformations, mainly driven by species turnover, affecting most of the communities (especially upper beach, embryo and mobile dunes) and several of their diagnostic species.
After the second field season, I analyzed the complete set of resurveyed data to provide a comprehensive, habitat-based (sensu Annex I 92/43/EEC), multi-dimensional assessment of temporal changes spanning across multiple levels of biological organization (community and species). Specifically, I quantified taxonomic changes in community composition and dominance structure using two dissimilarity metrics reflecting local immigration and extinction processes known under the general term “species exchange ratio”. To assess functional shifts over time I used functional dissimilarity and community weighted mean (CWM) values. Taxonomic and functional dissimilarities were then compared among habitats and tested for significance using null models. Finally, I characterized changes at the level of single species by analyzing species-abundance distributions at both time points (T0 and T1) and by testing changes in occurrence frequency and cover by mean of non-parametric tests. I could observe considerable changes involving both the taxonomic and the functional spheres, varying among habitats but acting at most levels: from the community level to that of single species. This, together with the disappearance of 78 out of the 334 historical plots and with observed changes often exceeding “simulated changes”, confirmed preliminary results and highlighted an intense vulnerability of upper beach and shifting dunes.
Overall, this study provided a detailed, habitat-based quantification of the transformations experienced by coastal dune plant communities in the last 10-15 years. Along with enhancing the knowledge of recent dynamics affecting these vulnerable environments, it also proved that resurveying studies based on quasi-permanent random plots are effective tools for monitoring coastal dune ecosystems, even when based on short-to-medium time-spans. Finally, it allowed identifying specific EU Habitats that appear to be particularly at risk, thus supplying an important resource to direct future conservation efforts and management strategies.
