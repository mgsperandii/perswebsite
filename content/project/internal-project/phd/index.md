Coastal dunes are listed among the most interesting ecosystems on earth, yet they are currently exposed to many threats globally affecting their conservation status. In the Mediterranean, several coastal dune habitats [have been recently assessed as either endangered or vulnerable](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/22542b64-c501-11e7-9b01-01aa75ed71a1/language-en), and their conservation status in Italy largely reflects the European picture. Identifying the most endangered habitats and monitoring their dynamics are key tasks that cannot be further procrastinated, if we want to avoid a complete disappearance of these ecosystems in the near future.

During my PhD, I used different approaches to quantify temporal changes characterizing Mediterranean coastal dune habitats in Central Italy.

I started by performing a [diachronic analysis of a large database of random, standardized, georeferenced plots](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-017-1454-1). Using LMs and GLMs I explored temporal trends in species richness and cover of targeted sandy habitats, while also analysing trends in selected native species and assessing patterns of invasion. Dune grasslands appeared as the most impacted habitat, with a negative trend in species richness and habitat cover. At the same time, results hinted at "early warnings" of degradation processes in shifting dunes, where a decline in the cover of the sand-binding _Ammophila arenaria_ subsp. _australis_, and a parallel increase in the cover of _Carpobrotus_ sp. were recorded.

During two field seasons (2017 and 2018), I performed a resurveying study on 334 historical plots belonging to the first portion of coastal zonation (from the upper beach to coastal dune grasslands). With the data collected during my first sampling season I tested the effectiveness of resurveying approaches based on quasi-permanent plots in revealing temporal changes in herbaceous communities of Mediterranean coastal dune systems. In particular, I quantified compositional shifts using Sørensen index of dissimilarity, I applied a partitioning method to determine whether observed change was driven by species turnover or by a “nestedness” effect, and I analyzed changes in the occurrence and cover of diagnostic species of the investigated habitats. Together with the disappearance of about 25% of historical plots, results revealed major transformations, mainly driven by species turnover, affecting most of the communities (especially upper beach, embryo and mobile dunes) and several of their diagnostic species.
After the second field season, I analyzed the complete set of resurveyed data to provide a comprehensive, habitat-based (sensu Annex I 92/43/EEC), multi-dimensional assessment of temporal changes spanning across multiple levels of biological organization (community and species). Specifically, I quantified taxonomic changes in community composition and dominance structure using two dissimilarity metrics reflecting local immigration and extinction processes known under the general term “species exchange ratio”. To assess functional shifts over time I used functional dissimilarity and community weighted mean (CWM) values. Taxonomic and functional dissimilarities were then compared among habitats and tested for significance using null models. Finally, I characterized changes at the level of single species by analyzing species-abundance distributions at both time points (T0 and T1) and by testing changes in occurrence frequency and cover by mean of non-parametric tests. I could observe considerable changes involving both the taxonomic and the functional spheres, varying among habitats but acting at most levels: from the community level to that of single species. This, together with the disappearance of 78 out of the 334 historical plots and with observed changes often exceeding “simulated changes”, confirmed preliminary results and highlighted an intense vulnerability of upper beach and shifting dunes.
Overall, this study provided a detailed, habitat-based quantification of the transformations experienced by coastal dune plant communities in the last 10-15 years. Along with enhancing the knowledge of recent dynamics affecting these vulnerable environments, it also proved that resurveying studies based on quasi-permanent random plots are effective tools for monitoring coastal dune ecosystems, even when based on short-to-medium time-spans. Finally, it allowed identifying specific EU Habitats that appear to be particularly at risk, thus supplying an important resource to direct future conservation efforts and management strategies.
