I am a vegetation scientist with a strong focus on temporal ecology. After obtaining my PhD at Roma Tre University, I landed in :es:Valencia:es:, where I joined for two years the [Functional Diversity Lab](https://functionaldiversitylab.com) at the [Desertification Research Centre](https://www.uv.es/uvweb/desertification-research-centre/en/desertification-research-centre-1285894590702.html) (institute of the Spanish National Research Council). Since October 2022, I am an ERA-funded postdoctoral fellow within the [Vegetation Science Group](https://botzool.cz/vegsci/) at ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿Masaryk UniversityðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿ (Department of Botany and Zoology). With my project [VegTrends](https://doi.org/10.3030/101090344), I will produce a comprehensive and representative report of multi-faceted temporal trends in the vegetation of European open habitats.
