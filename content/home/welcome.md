I am a vegetation scientist with a strong focus on temporal ecology. Since October 2022, I am an ERA-funded postdoctoral fellow in the [Vegetation Science Group](https://botzool.cz/vegsci/) at ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿Masaryk UniversityðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿ (Department of Botany and Zoology). With my project [VegTrends](https://doi.org/10.3030/101090344), I aim at producing a comprehensive and representative report of multi-faceted temporal trends in the vegetation of European open habitats.
