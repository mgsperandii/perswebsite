**VegTrends** is a research project funded under the **2021 "HORIZON.4.1 - Widening participation and spreading excellence" call**. To develop VegTrends, I will spend the next two years at the [Department of Botany and Zoology](https://botzool.sci.muni.cz/en) of the vibrant [Masaryk University](https://www.muni.cz/en). Specifically, I will join Milan Chytr√Ω's [Vegetation Science Group](https://botzool.cz/vegsci/).

Making use of the recently assembled [ReSurveyEurope](http://euroveg.org/eva-database-re-survey-europe) database, VegTrends will produce the first comprehensive and representative report of temporal trends in the vegetation of European open habitats. Specific objectives (O) addressed through two work packages (WPs) are: (i) assessing temporal trends in the vegetation of open European habitats and (ii) evaluating the effectiveness of protected areas (Natura2000 + Emerald Network) in conserving the vegetation of open European habitats.

If you're still curious about it, you can find more information on [VegTrends' page on Cordis](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101090344), an informative platform of all EU-supported R&D activities.

Stay tuned for updates!
